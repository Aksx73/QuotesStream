## About

App loads quotes from open source quotations API [Quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable).
Data will be always loaded from local database. Remote data (from API) and Local data is always synchronized.
App follows clean architecture pattern (MVVM). Whole app is organized with intent to create architecture like in multi-module approach.

A RemoteMediator implementation helps load paged data from the network into the database, but doesn't load data directly into the UI. Instead, the app uses the database as the [source of truth](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide/data-layer#source-of-truth).

## Architecture
This app uses [***MVVM (Model View View-Model)***](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#recommended-app-arch) architecture and uses [***RemoteMediator***](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/RemoteMediator) to get page from network and database.
