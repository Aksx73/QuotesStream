## About

App loads quotes from open source quotations API [Quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable). Uses Paging 3 library  for pagination with [RemoteMediator](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/RemoteMediator) for offline support.<br>
A RemoteMediator implementation helps load paged data from the network into the database, but doesn't load data directly into the UI. Instead, the app uses the database as the [source of truth](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide/data-layer#source-of-truth).<br><br>
App follows clean architecture pattern (MVVM). Whole app is organized with intent to create architecture like in multi-module approach.

## Architecture
This app uses [***MVVM (Model View View-Model)***](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#recommended-app-arch) architecture and uses [***RemoteMediator***](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/RemoteMediator) to get page from network and database.
